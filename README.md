# quick-html-image-viewer
A simple way to step through numbered .webp images using arrows keys.

## Instructions
- Ensure all the images are in the same folder as index.html and of type .webp.
  - They must be named sequentially. (1.webp, 2.webp, etc.)
- Set a value to "intNumOfImages" (if you have 6 images, set it to 6).

That's it! Use the arrow keys to navigate between images (Left and Up go backwards, Right and Down go forwards).
